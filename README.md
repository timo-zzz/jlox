"jlox" is an tree-walk Lox interpreter written in Java from the book.<br>
<br>
The guide to write this interpreter can be found in Part 2 of the book [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/).
Part 3 of the book consists of writing another interpreter for the Lox language, but in C. This interpreter is a bytecode interpreter focused more on efficiency.<br>
Here is my [clox](https://github.com/timo-zzz/clox) implementation.<br>
